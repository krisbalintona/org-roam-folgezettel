*DEVELOPMENT NOTE:* This project is unreleased. Although users are free to view and use its code, until official release, the project may undergo significant changes. Additionally, the author's current use of the project depends on bespoke configuration outside of the project. Only until the author's vision for the ideal usage of the project has stablized will these features be merged into this project. At that point, this project will likely be officially packaged and released.

This package is a progression of [[https://github.com/krisbalintona/denote-zettel-interface][krisbalintona/denote-zettel-interface]], which the author initially relied on while using denote instead of org-roam.

The vision of this package is my way of mitigating the difference between interfacing with a digital Zettelkasten and filing through a physical Zettelkasten. The approach of org-roam-folgezettel is to represent the folgezettel index in a list format (with =vtable.el=) and be able to navigate the index according to the numbering of notes and filter the shown notes arbitrarily (including by parents and siblings of a folgezettel index numbering).

+ List all org-roam nodes using ~vtable.el~
+ Filtering results
  - By subdirectory
  - By index numbering and index number relations (e.g. parent, children, descendants, etc.)
  - By tags
  - By folgezettel relations (e.g., children, descendants, parent)
  - Composability of filters (e.g., AND, OR)
+ Movement by folgezettel relations (e.g., up parent, down to child, forward/backward siblings)

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:

This project is currently not packaged in any official package repositories. Consequently, users will have to manually install this package.

Users can clone this package locally into their machine then evaluate something like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-roam-folgezettel
    :ensure t
    :load-path "/home/USER/PATH/TO/PROJECT/DIRECTORY/")
#+end_src
Or, if using Emacs-30 or newer:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-roam-folgezetel
    :vc ( :url "https://github.com/krisbalintona/org-roam-folgezettel.git"
          :rev newest))
#+end_src

This project depends on the following third-party packages:
+ org-roam
+ org-roam-ql
Until this project is packaged into an official repository such as MELPA, users will have to manually ensure these packages are installed prior to installing =org-roam-folgezettel=.

* User options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user-options
:END:

Users can see all available options with ~M-x customize-group RET org-roam-folgezettel RET~, or ~C-u C-h u org-roam-folgezettel- RET~.

* Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: commands
:END:

An org-roam-folgezettel listing of all org-roam nodes is available with ~M-x org-roam-folgezettel-list~. This command is left unbound by default.

For a full listing of org-roam-folgezettel's commands, see the output of ~C-h a org-roam-folgezettel- RET~.

** Filtering
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: filtering
:END:

Below are a list of the filtering commands currently available.
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-menu~ :: Transient menu for filtering commands
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-query-edit~ :: Manually modify the filter for the current org-roam-folgezettel buffer.
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-directory~ :: Filter the current buffer's node listing to SUBDIR.
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-title~ :: Filter the current node titles by REGEXP.
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-tags~ :: Filter the current node listing by TAGS.
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-person~ :: Filter the current node listing by PERSON.
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-children~ :: Filter the current node listing to the children of NODE.
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-descendants~ :: Filter the current node listing to the descendants of NODE.
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-undo~ :: Apply previous filter query in history.
+ ~org-roam-folgezettel-filter-redo~ :: Apply next filter query in history.
